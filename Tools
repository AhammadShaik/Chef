Vagrant – We use Vagrant and Virtualbox to test our cookbook code and run our tests on our local workstations.  

Test Kitchen – Test Kitchen is the tool we use to manage our Vagrant configurations, configure our environment to mirror
Production in a meaningful way and run our tests.

Chef-Zero – Chef-Zero is a lightweight local Chef Server that our testing VMs use to mimic our live Chef environment.

ChefDK – The Chef Development Kit provided by Opscode bundles various Chef tools together.  The beauty of ChefDK is that it comes
with an embedded Ruby environment and the necessary Ruby Gems required by the tools.  This is a great improvement if you’ve ever had to 
deal with pre-ChefDK local Ruby/RVM configurations, fluctuating gem dependancies and breaking changes between tools.

 ChefDK comes with chef-client, Berkshelf, Test Kitchen, ChefSpec, Foodcritic and more.
